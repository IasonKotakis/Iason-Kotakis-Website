<h2> Implementation </h2> 
<p> This is an implementation that is still work in progress. The notion behind it was to create a website where it would be able minimalistic enough without speaking volumes of it's complexity. </p> 
<p> It uses grid areas to adjust its section where it will either stack vertically or horizontally depending the context of each element. </p> 
<p> The Javascript is fairly simple where its purpose will store the according layout and colour for the user's next visit. So, if for example at first visit the default colour is white and the user swaps it for the colour yellow and closes that tab; the next time they visit the website again, the default colour will stay at yellow. This only applies for the specific browser the user decides to visit the website as if the user decides to use a different browser, the colour will be set to it's default value which is white. </p>
