<h1> Portfolio Website </h1>

<h2> Description </h2> 
<p> This project is work in progress ðŸš§. An updated 2.0 version is underway with necessary fixes and added content. <br>The notion behind this project was to create a website where it is minimalistic enough without speaking volumes of it's complexity. </p> 
<p> The website uses grid areas to adjust its section where it will either stack vertically or horizontally depending the context of each element. </p> 
  <p> The Javascript is fairly simple where it will store the according layout and colour when the user revisits my website. For example, at first visit the default theme is . If the user decides to change the theme to a different colour from the ones provided, then the next time they revisit my website, the default colour will stay the same (e.g. yellow). This only applies with the specific browser the user decided to visit my website though would the user decide to visit my website from a different browser, the theme of the page would be set to it's default value. </p>

<h2>AWS Setup</h2>
<p>In order to deploy my website, I used tools and services from AWS.<br><br> 
  First, I uploaded all the necessary images and files into an S3 bucket as well as setting up it's readability permissions by implementing a bucket policy.</p>
<p>Secondly, I created a record and registered domain with a simple traffic route through Route 53. From there, I requested an SSL certificate through the Certificate Manager tool.</p>
<p>Lastly, I created a distribution through Cloudfront, which I ended up linking both the SSL and Cloudfront to Route 53, therefore the domain name will get redirected to iasonkotakis.com instead of the original url link of the S3 bucket that was created.</p>
